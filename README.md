# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns 
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends 

### Challenge 
Three reasonable conclsions from the data: 
- From the outcomes based on goals, taking advantage of the visualization from the graph, I could easily see the result/ graph line for percentage successful and percentage failed are inverse naturally. The plays had failed most critically (100% failed) in getting funding when their goals was in range between $45000 to $49999 which also implies that the lowest percentage they succeed (0% successful) in getting funding was also the same range between $45000 to $49999; while the mostly succeed in getting funding for plays is when they set the goal with range Less than $1000 with 76% rate while the percentage failed recorded the lowest (24%) for the range simultaneously. 
- the result implies that the Louise’s play Fever the amount of goal and the campaign’s chances of success results inversion most likely. When Louise set her funding goal amount at the lowest rate which is less than $1000, it resulted the highest percentage of getting fund successfully with 76% while when she set the goal pretty much in high range $45000 to $49999, this recorded 0% of success with the goal. However, it only shows the tendency of the relationship is inversely proportional, it does not mean the relationship is a definite inverse proportion since her highest funding goal (greater than $50000) still resulted a few percentage (13%) of success. 
- From the outcomes based on launched date, the graph represents that the play was successful the mostly in May while the least successful in December statistically. 

Limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables of graphs: 

I learned that pivot tables and charts are very powerful and efficient tools that allow us to filter specific values we ant to analyze with visual customizations. However, there were some limitations in proving the cause or the reason with the following results. For example, we’ve learned that it was mostly successful in May however the dataset does not support any supportive evidence or factor for the results. Thus, it is very hard to analyze in depth and even ambiguous to give specific recommendations to Louise for her plays improvement in future. Therefore, I thought additional information such as factor/ analysis of the relationship between the launch date and the following outcomes for advanced analysis for Louise.
